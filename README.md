> Hippo has no relationship by any means with Istanbul Technical University, and its sub-organizations. Use at your own risk.

### Features

  - Parsing course schedule and loading it to a database
  - Persistent synchronoucity with tasking
  - Analytics service to get detailed statistics
  - Some primitive benchmarking utilities in order to test the environment.

### Version
1.6.0 (nightly build)

### Stack

Hippo uses following packages or applications, currently:

* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [hapi.js] - fast node.js network app framework
* [async] - asynchronous control-flow library
* [mongoose]Â - elegant mongodb object modeling for node.js
* [cheerio] - fast, flexible, and lean implementation of core jQuery designed specifically for the server.

> I personally do not believe that promise implementations (i.e. Promises/A+, kriskowal's Q, bluebird etc.) are mature enough to be played with, I chose to write the code with callbacks.

### Installation

Just copy the entire repository, and run it with instructions supplied at the bottom of the page.

### Development

Hippo app uses Node.js v5.3.0 (stable) as platform. Hippo app currently has no issues with [nvm].

Run the app with (assuming you have a MongoDB server):
```sh
$ node . --db mongodb://localhost:27017/hippo
```

### Todos

 - Write unit tests
